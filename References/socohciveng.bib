	abstract = {AbstractThis study examines the ways in which parental involvement in children's education changes over time and how it relates to children's social and academic functioning in school. Teachers provided information on parent involvement and school performance for 1,205 urban, kindergarten through third-grade children for 3 consecutive years. They rated the following four dimensions of parent involvement: frequency of parent-teacher contact, quality of the parent-teacher interactions, participation in educational activities at home, and participation in school activites. As predicted, the frequency of parent-teacher contacts, quality of parent-teacher interactions, and parent participation at school declined from Years 1 to 3. Every parent involvement variable correlated moderately with school performance and parent involvement in Years 1 and 2, and accounted for a small, but significant amount of variance in Year 3 performance after controlling for initial performance level. Participation in educational activities at home predicted the widest range of performance variables. Results suggest that enhancing parental involvement in children's schooling relates to improvements in school functioning.},

	abstract = {Despite the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and its implications, there is considerably less certainty or strength of belief among the general public in some industrialised countries. One explanation for the lack of consensus is the partisan nature of political debate about climate change. A survey of Australian politicians demonstrates that political party affiliation and ideology have a powerful influence on climate change beliefs. Politicians from Labor and Green parties (centre-left and progressive parties) exhibited beliefs that were more consistent with scientific consensus about climate change than non-aligned or conservative leaders. Moreover, political ideology (left?right) emerged as the most important predictor of politicians? climate change beliefs. These findings highlight the role of political partisanship and ideology in undermining consensus around climate change and suggest the need to build consensus through constructing climate change messages that appeal to closely held values and which advance the discussion of solutions along non-partisan lines.},

We apply the strategy method, that is, each subject had to design a complete strategy in advance instead of reacting spontaneously to a situation which occurs in the game. Game theory predicts very similar outcomes for the offer and the demand games. Our experiments, however, show significant differences in behavior between both games. Using the strategy method, allows us to explore the motivations leading to those differences. Since each subject played the same version of the game eight rounds against changing anonymous opponents we can also study subjects' learning behavior. We propose a theory of boundedly rational behavior, called the "anticipation philosophy", which is well supported by the experimental data.},

Of the twenty-nine existing comparisons, sixteen ﬁnd no difference, while four do ﬁnd differences, and nine comparisons ﬁnd mixed evidence. We also ﬁnd some indications about the underlying determinants of when the two methods lead to different responses. For example, it appears that levels of punishment are substantially lower with the strategy method. In addition, it also appears that difference across these elicitation methods are more likely when people make fewer contingent choices. Finally, in no case do we ﬁnd that a treatment effect found with the strategy method is not observed with the direct-response method.},

	title = {Measuring {Ethnic} {Bias}: {Comparing} {Tools} from {Behavioral} {Economics} and {Social} {Psychology}},
	abstract = {How can ethnic biases be measured? Concerns over social desirability bias have led many investigators to go beyond explicit survey questions and employ behavioral “games” from experimental economics. Yet, these games also have limitations. First, they have also proven sensitive to social desirability bias (Haley and Fessler, 2005). Second, by asking participants to make considered choices in a controlled environment, this approach is likely unable to detect biases rooted in the more immediate associations or reactions participants experience when faced with a non-coethnic, such as fear, disliking, or perceived threat. These reactions, even if denied behavioral expression in the lab, could nevertheless be important to out-of-lab behaviors that underpin ethnic politics and conﬂict. We adapt three tasks from social psychology that seek to measure more “automatic” or implicit responses of these types: the Aﬀect Misattribution Procedure, Face Anger Attribution Task, and Weapon Misidentiﬁcation Task. Together with several behavioral economics games and explicit survey measures, we test these tools in a sample of 183 residents of Nairobi belonging to two historically antagonistic ethnic groups (Luo and Kikuyu). We ﬁnd that: (1) though the Public Goods and Dictator games show no evidence of ethnic preferences of any kind, the less standard Choose Your Dictator game provides evidence that people expect others to condition their altruism in ethnically-biased ways; (2) the Aﬀect Misattribution Procedure shows strong evidence that participants have more negative (or less positive) aﬀect towards non-coethnics than coethnics; and (3) the Weapon Misidentiﬁcation Task shows evidence that particpants ﬁnd non-coethnics more likely to be holding a weapon as compared to co-ethnics, suggesting a fearful response or heightened threat-perception towards non-coethnics. We conclude that the Aﬀect Misattribution Procedure and Weapon Misidentiﬁcation Task show promise of detecting sources of bias to which more traditional behavioral games are blind.},

Despite its role in hiring decisions and job discrimination, negotiations, and conflict and competition between groups, economists have heretofore ignored the in-group-out-group bias. We question the universality of the bias by designing field experiments to test whether it extends to the cooperative behavior of one of the most successful and best-known modern collective societies, the Israeli kibbutz. The facts that kibbutz members have voluntarily chosen their lifestyle of cooperation and egalitarianism, the ease with which they could join the surrounding capitalist society, their disproportionate involvement in social and national causes and their revealed willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of Israeli society as a whole suggest that if ever there was a society of individuals whose cooperativeness extends equally to members and non-members, the kibbutz is it. Nonetheless, the findings from our field experiments indicate that kibbutz members display higher levels of cooperation when paired with anonymous kibbutz members than when paired with city residents. In fact, when paired with city residents, kibbutz members’ observed levels of cooperation are identical to those displayed by the city residents. Moreover, we present evidence that kibbutz socialization actually damages the willingness of members to cooperate with one another.},

We instruct subjects that “the rule is” to take the costly action. Their willingness to incur such a cost reveals respect for norms. We show that choices in this task are similar across ﬁve countries. Rule-following is correlated with norm-consistent behavior in dictator games, providing support for our interpretation.},

We model conﬂict as a two-agent rent-seeking contest for an indivisible prize. Before conﬂict arises, both agents may agree to allocate the prize by fair coin ﬂip to avoid the costs of conﬂict. The model predicts that “parity promotes peace”: in the pure-strategy equilibrium, agents with relatively symmetric conﬂict capabilities agree to resolve the conﬂict by using a random device; however, with sufﬁciently asymmetric capabilities, conﬂicts are unavoidable because the stronger agent prefers to ﬁght. The results of the experiment conﬁrm that the availability of the random device partially eliminates conﬂicts when agents are relatively symmetric; however, the device also reduces conﬂict between substantially asymmetric agents.},

	abstract = {Cultural psychologists and anthropologists argue that societies have developed heterogeneous systems of social organization to cope with social dilemmas and that an entire bundle of psychological characteristics has coevolved to enforce cooperation within these diﬀerent regimes. This paper develops a measure of the tightness of historical kinship structures to provide empirical evidence for this large body of theories. In the data, societies with loose ancestral kinship ties cooperate and trust broadly, which appears to be sustained through a belief in moralizing gods, universal moral values, internalized guilt, altruistic punishment, and largescale institutions. Societies with a historically tightly knit kinship structure, on the other hand, exhibit strong in-group favoritism: they cheat on and distrust outgroup members but readily support in-group members in need. This cooperation regime is enforced by tribalistic moral values such as in-group loyalty, emotions of external shame, revenge-taking, conformity to social norms, and strong local institutions. These relationships hold across historical ethnicities, contemporary countries, ethnicities within countries, and among migrants. The results suggest that religious beliefs, moral values, social preferences, emotions, social norms, and institutions all coevolved for the functional purpose of supporting cooperation systems that diﬀer in their level of tribalism.},

After controlling for the regression to the mean, we ﬁnd a weak effect of responsibility for one other person on risk taking as compared to choosing just for oneself. We, however, do ﬁnd that the number of others inﬂuenced by the choice matters: when it increases from one to three, risk averse subjects choose riskier options and risk loving subjects choose more cautiously, which pushes the choices towards the modal risk preferences in the population. Mutual responsibility makes choices for others shift even more in the same direction. The observed behavior is in accordance with the blame avoidance hypothesis: decision makers with responsibility try to reduce the amount of blame for their choices, which is minimal when the choices for others are consistent with what they would have chosen for themselves.},

We carried out two studies. The ﬁrst study entailed hypothetical situations and imaginary people; the second study was similar to the ﬁrst, but the dictator game component was incentivized (actual money) and involved actual receivers. Our subjects’ behavior towards others is signiﬁcantly affected by their respective identities. (1) Those that belong to the in-group are treated more favorably than those who belong to the out-group in nearly all identity categories and in all contexts. (2) Family and kinship are the most powerful source of differentiation, followed by political views, religion, sports-team loyalty, and music preferences, with gender being basically insigniﬁcant. (3) The hierarchy of identity categories is fairly stable across the four contexts. (4) Subjects give similar amounts and discriminate between in-group and out-group to similar degrees in the hypothetical and incentivized dictator games.},
